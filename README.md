Hello Hoomans of Earth.
It is I! Your favourite bird loving friend...*drumroll please*...TBird!!
You might be thinking, "Hey wait, why is this so into birds? Clearly doggos are the best animol"
To which I say, Yes. Yes, doggos are the best. But birds are EVEN BETTER. Because birds look down on people. Quite literally. And not in a mean kind of way like cats do. No no. Birdies know they are the best but they don't have a superiority complex. 
Also, the entire world is for them to poop on. Just washed your car? *POOP ATTACK* Just shaved your head? *POOP ATTACK* The whole world serves as a giant toilet for birds to poop on. 
And it's a good thing too. You know when people get too full of themselves? *POOP ATTACK!!* Nothing like dumping smelly poo on greedy corporate giants first thing in the morning. 
Anyway, I love birds, as you can tell. But there's no need to argue which animol is the best. They're all amazing in their own ways. No one should be made to feel bad about themselves (Except for probably hoomans. Hoomans are pretty bad. But not all hoomans though.)
Okay ciao. Have a great day and be kind to all living entities!
